Introduction
============

*Operon* is a modern C++ framework for `symbolic regression <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_regression>`_ that uses `genetic programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming>`_ to explore a hypothesis space of possible mathematical expressions in order to find the best-fitting model for a given `regression target <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis>`_.
Its main purpose is to help develop accurate and interpretable white-box models in areas such as `system identification <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_identification>`_.

Motivation
----------

*Operon* was motivated by the need to have a *flexible* and *performant* system that *works out of the box*. Thus, it was developed with the following goals in mind:

Modern concurrency model
    Traditional threading approaches are not optimal for today's many-core systems. This means designing the evolutionary main loop in such a way as to avoid synchronisation overhead and take advantage of C++17's `execution policies`_.

Performance
    By using an efficient linear tree representation where each ``Node`` is `trivial`_ and vectorized evaluation with the help of the `Eigen <https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/>`_ library. The encoding consumes 40 bytes per tree node, allowing practitioners to work with very large populations.

Ease-of-use
    *Operon* (the core library) comes with a command-line client that just works: you pass it a dataset and it will start optimizing. Its behavior can be configured by command line options, making it easy to integrate with any scripting environment or high-level language such as Python. A Python script is provided for performing experiments automatically aggregating the results.

    For more advanced use cases, we provide a C++ and a Python API, briefly illustrated with some `examples <https://github.com/foolnotion/operon/tree/master/examples>`_.

For an overview of *Operon* please have a look at the :doc:`features` page.

The software was also presented at GECCO'2020 *EvoSoft* workshop: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3377929.3398099. If you want to reference it in your publication, please use:
